<p>my name is HOUBOUBY Abdelwahed or simply AHoubouby. A morrocan developer.
programming enthusiast by day namely Java Spring framework and Angular. but by night i turn my passion to  distributed systems, Scala, JavaScript, Golang, K8S, and Docker.
Certified in Scala & Akka professionals.
k8s certificate is loading.</p><p>
----- skills -----
Worked with different stacks but my heart still belongs to Scala (Akka, Play framework),  ReactJS and distributed systems.

---- Education -----
Master degree in CS except that when it comes to CS education doesnt really play a huge factor. What counts is your passion, loving what you are doing while giving 100% of what you can provide.

My motto, "<span id="k">Stick to the plan stay focused and trust the process</span>".
<p>Cheers!</p>
